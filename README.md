> Step 1: Add it to your build.gradle (project):
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
> Step 2: Add it to your build.gradle (app)

```gradle
dependencies {
     implementation 'com.github.developwithishfaq:easy-fcm:latest_version'
}
```

## Usage

> First Step:
**Create Instance**
- Get server key from firebase console
- For **setTokenOrTopic()** in value section provide token of a device or a topic name, change **isTopic** value accordingly
- In **setNotificationData()** Provide model **NotificationData()** containing title and body of a notification
- Finally Build It

```
val helper = FcmPushHelper.Builder()
            .setServerKey(SERVER_KEY)
            .setTokenOrTopic(value = TOKEN_OR_TOPIC, isTopic = false)
            .setNotificationData(notification = NotificationData(TITLE, BODY))
            .build()
```
> Last Step:
Using that instance call **pushNotification()** function
```
helper.pushNotification(onSuccess = {
            Log.d(TAG, "onSuccess: ")
        }, onError = {
            Log.d(TAG, "onError: ")
        })
```
